# MVA Downloader

This is a very simple tool only for downloading the resources on [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com)

One reason for writting this tool is the subtitle could not be downloaded on the offical site, and you can download **.srt** file by this tool :)

### Usage
 
```
npm install
node bin/server
# then visit 127.0.0.1:3000 as follow
```

### This Fork
The reason behind this fork is to tweak the code so that it work nicely with Internet Download Manager
